# f1tenth-scoreapp-frontend

Client-side web app serving as frontend for the [f1tenth-scoreapp](../).

ðŸ‘‰ Available online at [f1tenth-scoreapp.netlify.app](https://f1tenth-scoreapp.netlify.app/)

The code is written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
and **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**. See more in the [Architecture](#architecture) section.

ðŸš§ **Note:** This is work in progress.

## Description

TODO

The UI of the app is fully translated and localized into Czech and English. By default, the app automatically
detects the locale to be used from the browser preferences. In addition, the locale can be changed manually in
the app settings.


## Architecture

_Currently_, it is a client-side-only application (SPA).
**It runs completely in the browser** and it **communicates with the [backend](../backend/) via APIs**
_(REST + WebSocket)_.

The code is written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
and **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**.

The project has **just three production dependencies** ([React](https://reactjs.org/),
[react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/)
and [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)). Everything else is implemented from scratch.


### Technology highlights

**Tooling:**
* Webpack â€“ custom configs, custom plugins
* Babel
* ESLint, AVA (tests), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
* Netlify for [Deployment](#deployment)
* CSS written in Sass (SCSS), vendor prefixes automatically added by autoprefixer with Browserslist

**Features:**
* [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)
  for all scripts and styles included from index.html
* PWA, [web app manifest](./app/manifest.json) including [maskable icons](https://web.dev/maskable-icon/)
* custom **routing** solution for React on top of
  the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API)
* custom state management for React (with persistence to Local Storage)
* **i18, l10n**
	* [Intl API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) (time,
	  numbers, plurals), see for example the [LocalizedDate](./app/components/LocalizedDate.tsx) component
	* advanced ICU messages, see for example [these messages](app/i18n/translations.cs.js#L25)
	* automatic locale detection/negotiation (`navigator.languages`) with support for overwriting the locale
	  on the app-level, see [LocaleLoader](./app/containers/LocaleLoader.tsx) component
* CSS â€“ fully responsive, Flexbox, Grid, animations, transitions, transforms, media queries, ...
* HTML5 semantic elements

## Development


### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 16.x
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) 1.x
- You can follow [this Node.js Development Setup guide](../NODEJS-SETUP.md).


### Set up

1. Install all dependencies with Yarn (run `yarn`).
2. You are ready to go.
3. Use `yarn start` to start dev server with HMR.
4. Then open `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser.


### Available commands

* `yarn start` â€“ Starts a development server with hot replacements.

* `yarn build` â€“ Builds the production version and outputs to `dist` folder. Note: Before running an actual
  build, `dist` folder is purged.

* `yarn analyze` â€“ Same as `yarn build` but it also outputs `stats.json`
  and runs [webpack-bundle-analyzer CLI][webpack-bundle-analyzer-cli].

* `yarn tsc` â€“ Runs TypeScript compiler. Outputs type errors to console.

* `yarn lint` â€“ Runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Outputs errors to console.

* `yarn test` â€“ Runs tests using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

* `yarn test-hot` â€“ Runs tests using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) in watch mode.

[webpack-bundle-analyzer-cli]: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer#usage-as-a-cli-utility


## Deployment

_Currently_, We use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which is practically a CDN on steroids with integrated
builds. There are 3 configuration files that affect the deployment behavior:
* [netlify.toml](./netlify.toml) â€“ global config
* [app/_headers](./app/_headers) â€“ HTTP headers customization (mainly for immutable files)
* [app_redirects](./app/_redirects) â€“ HTTP redirects and rewrites (fallback to index.html for client-side
  routing)
